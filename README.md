### About Me
Software engineer with a proven ability to deliver robust applications in collaborative settings with strict deadlines. As a student TA, I supervised lab groups of 4-5 students each week over two semesters and coached 12+ students on lecture materials, lab assignments and projects while balancing my own course work. In my previous career, I evaluated 500+ reality tv candidatesâ€™ social media for controversial statements, actions, or custom requirements defined by TV networks. I am excited to learn new technologies and eager to solve complex problems at a position on a collaborative team focused on developing dynamic back-end applications.
